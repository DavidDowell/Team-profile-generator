# Team-profile-generator

## Application Objective

Use the command line to grab user input about their team members. Once the quesitons have been answered, dynamically create HTML and CSS to format the team roster based on the input.

## How it Works

* The application is started by typing "node index.js" in the command line. A list of employee roles shows up (Manager, Engineer, Intern, DONE). The user chooses manager, and is prompted to enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
* After entering in the team manager's information, an option menu appears for the user to add engineers, interns, or finish building the team.
* If an engineer is being added, the user will enter in the engineer's name, ID, email, and Github username. Then the user is brought back to the option menu.
* If an intern is being added, the user will enter in the Intern's name, ID, email, and school. Then the user is brought back to the option menu.
* Once the user chooses the option to finish building the team, the HTML is generated with a stylesheet.
